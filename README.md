# Final-Countdown-Calender

https://bt616.github.io/final-countdown/


The final-countdown-calender keeps track of date and time and lets you log
text as a reminder. If you have trouble running on time or remembering what 
you have to do throughout the day then this calender is for you.

 We use jquery js and css on top of our html.
